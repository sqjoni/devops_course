OpenAI's chatGPT 4o LLM was used as an assistant in this exercise. It was used to ask syntax related
questions and code generation for the Dockerfiles and express.js. This was due to the prior good
experiences with the model and to improve efficiency. The help was sufficient to make this exercise
a lot quicker to complete. There really were not mistakes when it came to the LLM.
