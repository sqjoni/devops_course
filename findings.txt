Findings:
Containers share resources wit the host machine such as networking and mounted volumes. Containers have
an IP address that reflects the internal Docker network. Processes running inside a container are
isolated from the host machine, however, those can still be seen from the host. The networking is
done by setting up virtual bridges that isolate containers from each other and public network. Even
though containers share resources with the host, the container itself has no idea of a host being present.
